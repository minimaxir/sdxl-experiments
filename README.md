# Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 Experiments

Jupyter Notebooks for experimenting with Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 and the [sdxl-wrong-lora](https://huggingface.co/minimaxir/sdxl-wrong-lora). All these notebooks have been confirmed to work in Colab on a T4 GPU.

These notebooks include:

- [sdxl-wrong-lora comparison](sdxl_wrong_comparison.ipynb) ([Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/minimaxir/sdxl-experiments/blob/main/sdxl_wrong_comparison.ipynb)): A notebook to generate images with and without the `sdxl-wrong-lora` for comparison.
- [Wrong Image Generator](wrong_image_generator.ipynb) ([Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/minimaxir/sdxl-experiments/blob/main/wrong_image_generator.ipynb)): A notebook to generate synthetic "negative" images for training the `sdxl-wrong-lora` Dreambooth LoRA.
